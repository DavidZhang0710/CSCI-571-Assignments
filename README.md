# CS571 Full-Stack Artsy Projects

This repository contains my coursework for **CS571**, focused on full-stack development using the [Artsy API](https://developers.artsy.net/). The course is structured into four progressive assignments, each building upon the previous one, transitioning from static pages to a complete Android application.

## Project Overview

The core goal of these assignments is to explore different web and mobile technologies while integrating with a real-world public API. The Artsy API provides access to artist information, artworks, and more â€” allowing for the development of visually rich and responsive applications.
